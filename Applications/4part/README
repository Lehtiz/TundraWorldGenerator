Terrain generation example
--------------------------

This example uses TundraWorldGenerator to read input terrain heightmap
from external ASC file, and converts it into Tundra NTF format. It also
decorates the rest of the scene. i.e. it inserts skybox and waterplane.
Terrain surface weightmap is calculated as well based on the height
values of the input terrain. An avatar application is included as well.

To run the creation process, use the Makefile. Just type "make". It is
assumed that the directory structure is relative to TundraWorldGenerator.
Hence, it is assumed that that the tools are found from ../.. directory.

The project makes a reference to skybox textures and avatar application.
These can be found from the realXtend Tundra distribution. In order
to run the scene, you need to setup the paths so that Tundra finds those
files. This needs to be done manually, and it is not in the scope of this
example.
